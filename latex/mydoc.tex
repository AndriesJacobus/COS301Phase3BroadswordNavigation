\subsection{MEAN STACK}  
	MEAN stack is the best solution for building application using javascript and since we are implementing the MVC architectural pattern for the navUP system , MEAN stack is the best way to deploy the current architectural pattern . It includes mongo , express , angular and nodejs which allows us to built fast and maintable applications.
\subsubsection{MongoDB}	
MongoDB is a document-oriented database that provides high perfomace,availability and scalability. It works on the concepts of collection and documents. For the NavUP application , we used mongoDB to store data such as startpoint,endpoint or user preferences.

Express is fast and flexible framework for nodejs . 
\subsubsection{Nodejs}	
 Nodejs is JavaScript run-time environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.
